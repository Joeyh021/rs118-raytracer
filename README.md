# RS118 Raytracer

An implementation of [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/), translated from C++ to Rust for RS118.

This is the final product from <https://rs118.uwcs.co.uk/raytracer.html>, see there for the walkthrough of building your own. The commit history of this repository (roughly) mirrors the tasks from the project, so feel free to browse through it for solutions if you get stuck at any point.
